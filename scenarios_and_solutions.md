## Scenario #1: Encryption Management & Key Rotation

### 1. Main Challenges and Impacts of Key Rotation

**Challenges:**
- **Service Availability**: Rotating keys for active resources (RDS, DynamoDB, S3) may cause temporary service disruptions
- **Application Dependencies**: Applications must handle key rotation gracefully without breaking existing encryption/decryption operations
- **Cross-Environment Coordination**: Managing rotation across dev, staging, and production environments without conflicts
- **HSM Integration Complexity**: Coordinating between on-premises HSM and AWS KMS for BYOK keys
- **Policy Updates**: Key policies may need updates during rotation, affecting access patterns
- **Monitoring Blind Spots**: Ensuring all resources are tracked during the rotation process

**Impacts:**
- **Operational**: Potential downtime during key rotation windows
- **Security**: Temporary exposure if rotation fails partially
- **Performance**: Possible latency increases during re-encryption processes
- **Cost**: Additional compute and storage costs for re-encryption operations
- **Compliance**: Risk of non-compliance if rotation fails or is incomplete

### 2. Key Rotation Implementation Steps (High Level)

1. **Pre-Rotation Assessment**
   - Inventory all resources using each KMS key
   - Validate backup and recovery procedures
   - Test rotation in non-production environments

2. **HSM Key Generation**
   - Generate new key material in on-premises HSM
   - Validate key strength and compliance requirements
   - Prepare secure transport mechanisms

3. **AWS KMS Key Creation**
   - Import new key material to AWS KMS
   - Create new key version with updated material
   - Validate key accessibility and permissions

4. **Resource Migration**
   - Update RDS instances to use new key (during maintenance windows)
   - Re-encrypt DynamoDB tables with new key
   - Update S3 bucket encryption configurations

5. **Policy and Access Updates**
   - Update IAM policies referencing key ARNs
   - Modify application configurations
   - Update terraform/CloudFormation templates

6. **Validation and Cleanup**
   - Verify all resources are using new keys
   - Schedule old key material for deletion
   - Update monitoring and alerting systems

### 3. Compliance Monitoring Solution

**AWS Config Rules Approach:**
```json
{
  "ConfigRuleName": "kms-key-rotation-compliance",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "AWS",
    "SourceIdentifier": "KMS_KEY_ROTATION_ENABLED"
  },
  "Scope": {
    "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
      "AWS::KMS::Key"
    ]
  }
}
```

**AWS Systems Manager Compliance:**
- Create custom compliance items for each resource type
- Use SSM documents to check encryption key versions
- Automated remediation through SSM automation documents

**CloudWatch Custom Metrics:**
- Lambda function to periodically audit resource encryption status
- Custom metrics for compliance percentage by service/environment
- CloudWatch alarms for non-compliant resources

### 4. Securing Key Material Transportation

**Best Practices:**
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration**: Use AWS CloudHSM or on-premises HSM with dedicated network connections
- **VPN/Direct Connect**: Establish secure, dedicated network paths between on-premises HSM and AWS
- **Key Wrapping**: Implement proper key wrapping protocols using master keys
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Use X.509 certificates for mutual authentication
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all key material transfers
- **Encryption in Transit**: Multiple layers of encryption during transport

## Scenario #2: APIs-as-a-Product Architecture

### 1. Current Architecture Weaknesses

- **No Network Segmentation**: All APIs are public by design, increasing attack surface
- **Single Point of Failure**: Single CloudFront distribution for all APIs
- **Inefficient Internal Routing**: Internal calls unnecessarily traverse internet
- **Limited API Governance**: No differentiation between internal and external APIs
- **Regional Bypass Vulnerability**: Direct access to API Gateway endpoints bypassing WAF
- **Lack of Private Connectivity**: No VPC endpoints or private API gateways

### 2. Improved Architecture Design

**New Architecture Components:**

**Internal APIs:**
- Private API Gateway with VPC endpoints
- Internal Application Load Balancer
- VPC-native routing for internal traffic

**External APIs:**
- Public API Gateway behind CloudFront
- Enhanced WAF rules with geographic restrictions
- Origin access control for CloudFront

**Hybrid APIs:**
- Dual exposure: Private VPC endpoint + Public CloudFront
- Route 53 resolver for internal DNS resolution
- Conditional routing based on source IP/network

### 3. CloudFront Path-Based Routing Configuration

```yaml
# CloudFront Distribution with Multiple Origins
Origins:
  - Id: auth-api-origin
    DomainName: auth-api.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com
    CustomOriginConfig:
      HTTPPort: 443
      OriginProtocolPolicy: https-only
  
  - Id: payment-api-origin
    DomainName: payment-api.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com
    CustomOriginConfig:
      HTTPPort: 443
      OriginProtocolPolicy: https-only

# Cache Behaviors for Path-Based Routing
CacheBehaviors:
  - PathPattern: "/auth/*"
    TargetOriginId: auth-api-origin
    ViewerProtocolPolicy: redirect-to-https
    
  - PathPattern: "/payment/*"
    TargetOriginId: payment-api-origin
    ViewerProtocolPolicy: redirect-to-https
```

### 4. Protecting Regional API Gateway Endpoints

**Solution: API Gateway Resource Policies with CloudFront Headers**

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:execute-api:*:*:*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:RequestedRegion": "eu-west-1"
        },
        "StringLike": {
          "aws:SourceIp": [
            "CloudFront-IP-Range/*"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Additional Security Measures:**
- Custom headers from CloudFront that API Gateway validates
- WAF rules on regional API Gateway
- VPC endpoints for internal API access
- Network ACLs and security groups

## Scenario #4: AWS Backup Implementation

*[Terraform module implementation will be provided in a separate artifact]*

### Requirements Summary
- Cross-region backup replication
- Cross-account backup copying
- WORM (Write Once, Read Many) protection via Vault Lock
- Automated resource selection via tags
- Configurable frequency, retention, and encryption

### Key Components
- Backup plans with multiple rules
- Backup vaults with cross-region replication
- Vault lock policies for WORM compliance
- IAM roles and policies for backup operations
- Resource selection via tag-based queries

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Implement compliance monitoring for key rotation
2. **Short-term**: Deploy improved API architecture with private endpoints
3. **Medium-term**: Complete key rotation automation
4. **Long-term**: Full backup policy implementation with cross-account replication

## Security Considerations

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: All IAM policies follow minimal permission requirements
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers for each component
- **Audit and Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Disaster Recovery**: Cross-region and cross-account redundancy
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for all data at rest and in transit
